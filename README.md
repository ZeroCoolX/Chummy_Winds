# Algebro - Class is now in session and you want nothing to do with it! 

The development team Chummy Winds has created a way to take you back to a time of daydreaming and doodling in our first ever Ludum Dare game jam! Take control of the little dude and fight your way through 3 beautifully designed stages, dashing between 2D and 3D to fend off the blood thirsty shapes who are trying to suck you into their world

Move with the mouse cursor
A key - shift to Triangle shape
S key - shift to Circle shape
D key - shift to Square shape
Space/Click - Dash Attack
ESC - Pause and View Controls
Shift to the matching shape and dash into baddies to clear them from the stage.
The blue meter shows you how much stamina you have left toperform a dahs, while the red meter displays how much time you have left in shape mode before your little dude turns back into 3D mode, where you are vulnerable to lose health! But watch out, colliding with the wrong baddie shape will immediately send you back into 3D mode!

### Tips
 You can move underneath obstacles when in 2D/Shape mode, ust like the baddies.
If you find yourself clicking off the game window too often while dashing, try using the space bar instead.
